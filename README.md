Demographic Data Analyzer

This project analyzes demographic data from the 1994 U.S. Census database, following the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python project.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset is downloaded directly from freeCodeCampâ€™s GitHub repository using the requests module and saved locally as adult.data.csv.

Each record contains attributes such as age, education, occupation, race, sex, hours-per-week, native country, and salary level (>50K or <=50K).

## Steps Performed

1. Dataset Loading

Fetched dataset from the freeCodeCamp URL using requests.

Loaded into a Pandas DataFrame with column names for clarity.
